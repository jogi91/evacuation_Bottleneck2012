## General Introduction

Last year was full with news about sinking ships, the most notable example being the Costa Concordia which ran aground near the Italian coast. We want to simulate the evacuation from a sinking ship with the purpose in seeing the influences of small exits, which are limited in capacity (i.e. rescue boats).

## The Model

Our model is based on a hypothetical scenario. Because of a machine malfunction, an explosive gas accumulates in the ship and it cannot be blown out. So the ship has to be evacuated. To simplify the modelling, we will use the deck plans of the costa voyager (http://www.kreuzfahrtberater.de/deckplan.php?schiff=Costa+Voyager&bf&dpe=2) and only use the deck with the rescue boats. The passengers will enter it by the stairs.

We want to study the effects of different distributions of passengers to the stairs to the boats, whereby the stairs can have different capacities. The influence of the total amount of passengers can be varied and the panic level, which is expressed by the average speed of a single passenger. At higher speeds of course, not all passengers can keep up. All these Variables will affect the time taken to get all passengers to boats.

## Fundamental Questions

Which is the best strategy for evacuation concerning the choice of the way towards the rescue boats. Should all passengers dirstribute equally over the entries, or is there a better one? Also, which one takes longer: a high panic level on a nearly empty ship or a low panic level on a very full (overfull?) ship. What happens, if a boat suddenly is inoperable? How can the reaction be optimized?

## Expected Results

On the distribution, we expect some similar law as in a parallel circuit of resistors. A low resistance means higher current.
