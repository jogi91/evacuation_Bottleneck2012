> * Group participants names: Benedek, Johannes Weinbuch
> * Project Title: Simulating a panic on a cruise ship 

## General Introduction

Last year was full with news about sinking ships, the most notable example being the Costa Concordia which ran aground near the Italian coast. We want to simulate the evacuation from a sinking ship with the purpose in seeing the influences of small exits, which are limited in capacity (i.e. rescue boats)
(States your motivation clearly: why is it important / interesting to solve this problem?)
(Add real-world examples, if any)
(Put the problem into a historical context, from what does it originate? Are there already some proposed solutions?)

## The Model

independent variables: number of boats, capacity of one boat, number of passengers

(Define dependent and independent variables you want to study. Say how you want to measure them.) (Why is your model a good abtraction of the problem you want to study?) (Are you capturing all the relevant aspects of the problem?)


## Fundamental Questions

If there's a panic, can a similar disaster as the titanic happen, even if there are more boats now?

(At the end of the project you want to find the answer to these questions)
(Formulate a few, clear questions. Articulate them in sub-questions, from the more general to the more specific. )


## Expected Results

No.

(What are the answers to the above questions that you expect to find before starting your research?)


## References 

(Add the bibliographic references you intend to use)
(Explain possible extension to the above models)
(Code / Projects Reports of the previous year)


## Research Methods

(Cellular Automata, Agent-Based Model, Continuous Modeling...) (If you are not sure here: 1. Consult your colleagues, 2. ask the teachers, 3. remember that you can change it afterwards)


## Other

(mention datasets you are going to use)
