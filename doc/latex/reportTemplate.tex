\section{Abstract}

This work takes a look into the evacuation mechanisms of a cruise ship in case
of an emergency.  A simple model is implemented which is used to simulate the
dynamics of such a system.  The main emphasis was on the limited capacity of
the exits, since that is the key element for a rescue boat. 


\section{Individual contributions}

The work on this project was split among us to fit our strengths the best way
possible.  Because of his knowledge in image editing and formats, Johannes
Weinbuch focused on the image manipulation for the input and implemented the
loading of the image into MATLAB, improving the existing solutions from the
previous courses. He further took a large part of the writing for the report
and executing the simulations, which were written by Benedek Vartok.  He
evaluated which code from previous semesters could and should be reused, and
implemented the missing parts for our special case.  Also, he wrote the output
mechanisms for the simulation, so that the data could be used for analysis.


\section{Introduction and Motivations}

In January 2012, the Costa Concordia hit a rock and ran aground\cite{bbcnews}.
This event got great media attention for a long time so we decided to take a
closer look at the evacuation of a cruise ship.  The question is, what is the
best stratgy to leave the ship?  This question should for sure be answered with
one of the emergency drills, but it is always good to have some background
knowledge.


\section{Description of the Model}

The model is a big simplification of real life, otherwise it would be way too
complex to simulate.  It assumes that the ship is intact, that there is calm
sea and that the passengers are obliged to leave the ship.  A possible
explanation for this could be a machine defect which leaks explosive gas in a
badly ventilated room in the ship.  Further, we assume that the rescue boats are
like doors, which close after a certain amount of people going through them. 

Since we also assume that the other doors, for example between the rooms or
floors, are constantly open and working, we only simulate one deck, the one
with the exits to the rescue boats.  The evacuation of multiple floors in a
static building has already been researched in \cite{multilevel}. 

After these simplifications, the task left to simulate was the evacuation of a
single floor with some elements that can change.  For this task, we chose a
simple agend based modelling solution as described in \cite{helbing}.  A
passenger is treated as a particle.  It has a mass, and there are physical and
social forces, accelerating that mass so that it cannot always follow its
desired direction.  The desired direction is implemented as the shortest path
to the nearest exit.  For the exact formulae for the forces see
section~\ref{sub:movement}.

\section{Implementation}

\subsection{Input}

\label{sub:input}

Since we had some good projects which covered similar
problems as ours, we could get some ideas from them, but at the same time
improve them.  Namely, there are \cite{multilevel} and \cite{airplane}.  As far
as the input for the simulation is concerned, we see two approaches in these
works for getting the map data into the simulation.  In \cite{multilevel}, a
simple PNG image is used to get a map into the simulation. The problem here is
that only a certain RGB color value can be read out of the image.  This can
lead to problems if the image is processed with automatic or semiautomatic
image manipulation programs, since only a minor difference in color can prevent
the generation of the desired data.  In \cite{airplane}, the image format is
even more simple.  There is only a bitmap image read into MATLAB.  Since the
bitmap images can use a colormap, MATLAB doesn't use 3 channels but a unique
number for each color in an image matrix to give every pixel its color.  This
has the same problem as the PNG solution regarding how exactly the colors have
to be set, but the different parts of the image can be separated with less
code.

We took the best of both solutions. We used the PNG-format with indexed colors.
So we have the most flexibility with very little usage of disk space.  There is
no special ``wall color'' or anything like that, just a simple rule how the
colormap is read: Color 0 of the map specifies walls, color 1 free space.
Then, there can be any number of spawn zones.  Spawn zones are the areas in the
image, where new agents can be placed. With different spawn zones, it is
possible to account for different situations: A ballroom is different from a
staircase.  The number of spawn zones is specified in the configuration file.
At last, there is an arbitrary number of exits.  Again, each exit can have its
own parameters or can even be handled specially in the program's code.

\end{figure}
To manipulate the colormap, any slightly sophisticated image manipulation
program should suffice. We used the free software Gimp \cite{gimp}. It has a
very convenient command which allows the user to rearrange the colormap. This
is shown in figure~\ref{gimpscreenshot}.

\subsection{The Simulation Routines}
\label{sub:The simulation Routines}

\subsubsection{Code Reuse from Multilevel Evacuation}

Since this project has very similar foundations as \cite{multilevel} (like the
forces used in the model), we were able to use a lot of code and some design
decisions from their program.  Some of the structure needed to be changed to
implement our custom features, but for example the utility functions for the
Fast Sweeping algorithm (\texttt{fastSweeping.c}), generating gradients
(\texttt{getNormalizedGradient.c}) and the linear interpolation
(\texttt{lerp2.c}) which the other group wrote in C were copied without
modification into our code-tree.

\subsubsection{General Structure}

\label{sub:structure}

During the entire program run, one single big structure is used to hold and
pass around the state of the simulation.

At first, this structure is initialized with the fields that are given in the
configuration file by \texttt{loadConfig}\footnote{The MATLAB implementation of
our functions is in the \texttt{code} directory: \texttt{loadConfig} can be
found in the file \texttt{code/loadConfig.m} etc.}.  Then, \texttt{initialize} runs
over the struct and calculates some data needed in the simulation, such as the
vector fields needed for the wall and exit force fields using the
\texttt{fastSweeping} method which we got from \cite{multilevel}.

\subsubsection{Main Loop}

\texttt{simulate} is the routine we call when we do an entire simulation.  It
uses the \texttt{loadConfig} and \texttt{initialize} functions to initialize
its runtime data, then it does the loop calculating forces, adding new agents,
progressing the agents, updating the exit vector fields, potentially plotting
and saving frames and collecting data.

These steps will be explained in detail in the following sections.

\subsubsection{Agent Placement}

As mentioned in section~\ref{sub:input}, our model of the ship has different
spawning zones where new agents can start out at.  The way we implemented it,
in every step of the simulation loop it is checked whether there are any
remaining agents that need to be placed (i.e. agents which are not in the
simulation yet).  If there are, then for every agent the program chooses a
random point in the spawning zones and places him there, unless it detects that
the agent would collide either with walls or other agents.  In that case, the
routine tries the placement for that agent up to five times, each time with a
new random position.  If the agent couldn't be placed, then he will have a
chance to spawn in the next time step.

This method was implemented in \texttt{placeAgents}.  In the same method, the
basic properties of the agent get assigned, like the starting zero velocity and
a random radius.

\subsubsection{Agent Dynamics}
\label{sub:movement}

To simulate the movement of the agents in this physical model, different forces
need to be calculated in every step on every agent.  All of the force formulae
have been taken from \cite{helbing}.  These forces have been separated into the
following functions which are called by \texttt{simulate}:

\begin{description}

\item[\texttt{addDesiredForces}] is responsible for making the agents seek the
exits of the layout, in our case the rescue boats.

This is accomplished by giving an agent a ``desired'' velocity vector pointing
along the shortest path to the nearest exit.  The vector is sampled and
interpolated (using \texttt{lerp2} from \cite{multilevel}) from a vector field
which is calculated at the beginning (see \ref{sub:structure}) of the
simulation and when the exits change (see \ref{sub:exitremove}).

Using this desired vector $\vec{e}$ we can say what force addition the agent gets:

\[ \vec{F}_\text{desired} = m \frac{v_0 \vec{e} - \vec{v}}{\tau} \]

where $m$ is the agent's mass, $v_0$ is his target speed, $\vec{v}$ is
his current velocity vector and $\tau$ is a characteristic time determining how
fast the desired velocity should be reached.

\item[\texttt{addInterAgentForces}] models the repulsive forces between agents:
They do not want to get too close together and if they touch, they have to be
kept apart physically and some friction appears.  The model we use has this
formula:

\[ \vec{F}_\text{agents} = \big(A e^{(r-d)/B} + k \max\{0, r-d\}\big) \vec{n} +
                     \kappa \max\{0, r-d\} \Delta \vec{v} \cdot \vec{t} \]

where $r$ is the sum of radii of both agents, $d$ is the distance between the
center points of the agents, $\vec{n}$ is the normalized vector between the two
agents, $\vec{t}$ is the tangential vector and $\Delta \vec{v}$ is the velocity
difference vector.  $A$ influences the magnitude of the ``social'' repulsive
force, $B$ specifies a factor for the range of influence for this force, $k$
gives the strength of the physical separation force and $\kappa$ is a friction
coefficient.

For finding possible agent pairs to calculate the function on we used the naive
approach of checking every possible pairing with two nested loops and then
using a cutoff distance to avoid calculating this complicated force expression
when it's too small to matter anyways.  This method has complexity
$O(N_\text{agents}^2)$ which is far for optimal; we also tested the Range Tree
implementation of \cite{multilevel} for our program, however benchmarks didn't
show a noticeable gain in efficiency.

\item[\texttt{addWallForces}] calculates agents avoiding and experiencing
resistance from walls.  Just like agent-agent repulsion, this force has a
``social'', a physical and a frictional component:

\[ \vec{F}_\text{walls} = \big(A e^{(r-d)/B} + k \max\{0, r-d\}\big) \vec{n} -
                    \kappa \max\{0, r-d\} (\vec{v} \cdot \vec{t}) \vec{t} \]

where $r$ is the radius of the agent, $d$ is his distance from the wall,
$\vec{n}$ is the wall normal vector, $\vec{t}$ is the wall tangent vector and
$\vec{v}$ is the agent's velocity vector.  The coefficients are the same as in
$F_\text{agents}$.

Accessing the wall distances and normals is done similarly to
\texttt{addDesiredForces}, with precalculated fields using the Fast Sweeping
method.

\item[\texttt{progressAgents}] applies the forces from the above listed
functions, using them to update the agents' positions and velocities for the
next simulation step.

To accomplish this, the leap-frog integration scheme was used.  In every step,
the following recalculations of the velocities and positions of the agents take
place:

\begin{align*}
\vec{v} &= \vec{v} + \Delta t \cdot \frac{\vec{F}}{m}  \\
\vec{x} &= \vec{x} + \Delta t \cdot \vec{v}
\end{align*}

This method is fairly well suited for physical simulations with forces such as
these.  However, extra measures were taken to improve the stability of our
program:  Before doing any further calculations with them, the velocities and
forces get clipped to a configurable maximum magnitude to avoid instabilities
for too high step-sizes or too strong force parameters.

Without this, the simulation of some agents might get out of control if they
get too close to walls or to other agents and behave in unphysical ways.
